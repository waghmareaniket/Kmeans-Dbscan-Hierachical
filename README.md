# Kmeans-Dbscan-Hierachical
Implemented and compared K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering using Python and scikit-learn. Visualized clusters and analyzed their behavior on different datasets using matplotlib and seaborn. Explored the strengths of each algorithm in handling varied data distributions in unsupervised learning.
